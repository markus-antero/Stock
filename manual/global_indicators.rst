Food production
---------------

Finland ranks 13 - http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/good-enough-to-eat

Energy 
------
EU - Finland (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Infographic_REN-2004-2014.png) - top 2 on renewable energies in Europe (and globally) - http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Energy_from_renewable_sources
Global energy consumption ( http://www.iea.org/ ) - https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf

Key issues

World energy consumption continues to rise

Steady increase in overall consumption (8)

Oil (page 10)

coal (page 14) - china

World population 
----------------
rapid increase in regional density and volume

Estimated to reach 9.5 billion by the year 2050 
(This means that within my (projected) lifetime, the world population is going to double in size from 4.78 billion to 9.5)  

Global population is driven regionally

Population of Europe (~500 million - stable, not increasing)

correlation to resource consumption -> increase in population correlation with resource consumption

Problems 
--------
Complex and difficult issue
Fake news
Over simplifications - Misguided opinions
Videos like - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9Qt-bSz40

Conclusions
-----------
Deficit of existing resources will continue to grow annually (fuelled by population growth in specific regions)

the UN is disenfranchised from reality
Local bubbles - misalignment in opinions.
