17 Metrics to monitor in US
===========================

Manufacturing Jobs

Manufacturing jobs clearly matter a lot to Trump. He talked about them constantly on the campaign trail before the election; he’s been tweeting about them constantly since. So in the coming months and years, we should watch what happens with them -- and the metric to look at is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly count of payroll employment in the manufacturing sector.

Trump's success or failure, both economically and as it pertains to his re-election prospects, will be judged by how the four key Midwest states he flipped -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin -- perform. Those four states have had essentially no net growth in their labor force since the year 2000.

Working-Class Men
-----------------
On the campaign trail, Trump highlighted the need to look beyond the unemployment rate to understand the challenges that today’s workers are facing. Trump’s promise was broader than simply increasing the number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. It was to make jobs plentiful for those left behind: working class men. His evidence? Labor force participation rates of prime age (25-54) men with a high-school degree or less have plummeted over the last 50 years.

Curiosity About Canada
----------------------

*Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart. 

A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular.

Google-search interest for Canadian immigration tends to increase when people are frustrated with the state of the country. During Obama’s presidency, the search popularity of “move to Canada” ranged between 1,000 and 10,000 queries a month. It averaged higher than under former Bush, but the financial crisis might have contributed to that fact.

Early Exit Index 
----------------
Ladbrokes, the British oddsmaker, is not bullish on Donald Trump. 
In November, the company began offering odds that Trump will resign or be impeached before his first term concludes. 
Odds started at 3-1, or 25 percent. Now they're even. 

Betting markets don’t always foretell the future, but they're pretty good reflections of attitudes about the present. If the odds rise in Trump's favor, we'll know his administration is beginning to gain traction. If the odds of an early departure grow even worse, well, hold on to your red MAGA hat.  FRANCIS WILKINSON

Right Track, Wrong Track
------------------------
A traditional poll question -- "Is the nation headed in the right direction or off on the wrong track?" -- will be an instructive guide to Trump. The public will never much like him; he's not an appealing man. But many voters think he could produce results. This metric measures how people feel overall, about the economy, the social fiber, national security. In this month's Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, 52 percent of the public said the nation was on the wrong track, with 36 percent saying the opposite. If the right direction moves up to the mid-to-high 40s, that's good for the president. If it stays in the 30s, he's in trouble.

Dow Plus Approval Rating
------------------------
Here are two ways to evaluate Trump’s performance after his first six months: (1) the performance of the stock market and (2) his approval rating.

Though both measures enlist the wisdom of crowds, they are highly imperfect. The most important job of a president is to increase the nation’s well-being. That is a capacious concept, including liberty as well as economic factors (employment levels, poverty levels, per-capita gross domestic product). Because it is hard to specify a president’s contribution to social well-being, we have to rely on crude proxies, at least in the short term.

If the stock market is going up, investors are thinking that the Trump administration is not damaging the nation’s economic performance or introducing undue uncertainty. As of this writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is over 19,700. If it exceeds 21,000 in six months, that’s a strong signal; if it falls below 18,500, Trump’s economic plans are probably failing.

Deficit as Percentage of GDP
----------------------------
Trump has promised huge tax cuts coupled with giant government spending programs for infrastructure and the military. That combination is normally a formula for exploding budget deficits, which constrain prosperity by reducing the funds available for companies and individuals to spend and invest. At the same time, Trump has also promised to unleash huge economic growth. If he does, the deficits might not materialize or matter.

Can he pull it off? A metric that tracks the relationship of deficits and growth is the U.S. budget deficit or surplus as a percentage of gross domestic product. It had its biggest annual improvement under Obama of any president over four decades before and after President Bill Clinton, who saw perennial deficits transformed into annual surpluses. Let's see if Trump can match that performance.  MATTHEW A. WINKLER

The Trade Deficit
-----------------
Trade deficits matter less than politicians and the public generally think, but it may nonetheless turn out to be an important number to watch. That's because Trump and several of his economic advisers have argued that the trade deficit is a large drag on the economy and have said that it should be brought down from $460 billion to zero. 

They are counting on this decline to boost the economy enough to generate the revenue to make their budgets add up.

Will the statistic cooperate? The dollar has been appreciating for much of the last year, which tends to expand the trade deficit by making U.S. imports cheaper for Americans and U.S. exports more expensive for foreigners.

Tech Giants' Offshore Cash
--------------------------
Trump has made many absurd promises, but he's also promised to fix an absurd situation: U.S. companies, notably in the tech sector, prefer to keep their cash overseas because the U.S. has one of the highest corporate income taxes in the developed world. Trump hopes to bring the money back with a tailor-made tax cut.

Regs, Regs, Regs
----------------
Trump ran against global markets and creative destruction. 
He talks like a crony capitalist ready to dish out rewards and punishments from the White House. Except, that is, when he talks like a deregulator or appoints those who do. On his victory tour he pledged “to eliminate every single regulation that hurts our farms, our workers and our small businesses” — an extravagant promise indeed.

So which administration will we get, the meddlesome personal dealmaker or the burden-lifting business sympathizer? The metric I’ll be watching is the RegData index. Rather than measuring the sheer quantity of regulation, it tracks their content, flagging words like “shall” and “must” that create legal obligation. 

RegData offers a good measure how much regulation is expanding during a given administration. Combined with other indicators, it also allows scholars to drill down on the critical question: How much is political pull replacing value creation as the source of corporate profits?  VIRGINIA POSTREL

Home Prices
-----------
Whatever you think of the Obama administration, it’s been a good time for one group: Washington, D.C., homeowners, who have seen median home prices in the capital increase by roughly half. 

Bannon's Mentions
-----------------
Stephen K. Bannon stands to have enormous power as chief strategist in the Trump White House. He is also perhaps the most controversial member of senior leadership, having overseen a propagandistic media company with global political ambitions and a following among sexists and racists.

Syria's Dying Children
----------------------
An important number to watch during Trump's presidency is 15,948. That is, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the number of children who have been killed in the Syrian Civil War as of Dec. 13, 2016. 

Compared to the estimated total death toll of 450,000, that's a relatively small number. It's the most heartbreaking one, though. It shames Syria's dictator and his Iranian and Russian enablers. It shames the Islamic State, al-Nusra and other jihadists, too. And it shames western leaders like Obama who failed to stop the slaughter. Now this will be Trump's problem. One way to measure Trump's leadership on the world stage will be to count how many more children die in Syria's foul war.
