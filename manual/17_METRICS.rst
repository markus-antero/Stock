===================================================

Manufacturing Jobs

Manufacturing jobs clearly matter a lot to Trump. He talked about them constantly on the campaign trail before the election; he’s been tweeting about them constantly since. So in the coming months and years, we should watch what happens with them -- and the metric to look at is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly count of payroll employment in the manufacturing sector.

Trump's success or failure, both economically and as it pertains to his re-election prospects, will be judged by how the four key Midwest states he flipped -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin -- perform. Those four states have had essentially no net growth in their labor force since the year 2000.

Working-Class Men
-----------------
On the campaign trail, Trump highlighted the need to look beyond the unemployment rate to understand the challenges that today’s workers are facing. Trump’s promise was broader than simply increasing the number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. It was to make jobs plentiful for those left behind: working class men. His evidence? Labor force participation rates of prime age (25-54) men with a high-school degree or less have plummeted over the last 50 years.

Right Track, Wrong Track
------------------------
A traditional poll question -- "Is the nation headed in the right direction or off on the wrong track?" -- will be an instructive guide to Trump. The public will never much like him; he's not an appealing man. But many voters think he could produce results. This metric measures how people feel overall, about the economy, the social fiber, national security. In this month's Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, 52 percent of the public said the nation was on the wrong track, with 36 percent saying the opposite. If the right direction moves up to the mid-to-high 40s, that's good for the president. If it stays in the 30s, he's in trouble.

If the stock market is going up, investors are thinking that the Trump administration is not damaging the nation’s economic performance or introducing undue uncertainty. As of this writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is over 19,700. If it exceeds 21,000 in six months, that’s a strong signal; if it falls below 18,500, Trump’s economic plans are probably failing.

Deficit as Percentage of GDP
----------------------------
Trump has promised huge tax cuts coupled with giant government spending programs for infrastructure and the military. That combination is normally a formula for exploding budget deficits, which constrain prosperity by reducing the funds available for companies and individuals to spend and invest. At the same time, Trump has also promised to unleash huge economic growth. If he does, the deficits might not materialize or matter.

Can he pull it off? A metric that tracks the relationship of deficits and growth is the U.S. budget deficit or surplus as a percentage of gross domestic product. It had its biggest annual improvement under Obama of any president over four decades before and after President Bill Clinton, who saw perennial deficits transformed into annual surpluses. Let's see if Trump can match that performance.  MATTHEW A. WINKLER

The Trade Deficit
-----------------
Trade deficits matter less than politicians and the public generally think, but it may nonetheless turn out to be an important number to watch. That's because Trump and several of his economic advisers have argued that the trade deficit is a large drag on the economy and have said that it should be brought down from $460 billion to zero. 

They are counting on this decline to boost the economy enough to generate the revenue to make their budgets add up.

Will the statistic cooperate? The dollar has been appreciating for much of the last year, which tends to expand the trade deficit by making U.S. imports cheaper for Americans and U.S. exports more expensive for foreigners.

Syria's Dying Children
----------------------
An important number to watch during Trump's presidency is 15,948. That is, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the number of children who have been killed in the Syrian Civil War as of Dec. 13, 2016. 

Compared to the estimated total death toll of 450,000, that's a relatively small number. It's the most heartbreaking one, though. It shames Syria's dictator and his Iranian and Russian enablers. It shames the Islamic State, al-Nusra and other jihadists, too. And it shames western leaders like Obama who failed to stop the slaughter. Now this will be Trump's problem. One way to measure Trump's leadership on the world stage will be to count how many more children die in Syria's foul war.
