2. Global energy consumption ( http://www.iea.org/ ) - https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf

Key issues:

- Steady increase in overall consumption (8)

World population 
----------------
rapid increase in regional density and volume

Estimated to reach 9.5 billion by the year 2050 
(This means that within my (projected) lifetime, the world population is going to double in size from 4.78 billion to 9.5)  

Global population is driven regionally
